# sKreet Art
## Created by Sturdy-Guac

sKreet Art is an attempt at cataloging the forgotten art around the city of Richmond, VA.  
We give you an **informative photo gallery** and an **interactive map** allowing you to explore the depths of this richly adorned, luscious metropolitan.  
Of course we don't condone any illegal activities, but we do like art!
